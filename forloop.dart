//The for loop is used when we know how many times a block of code will execute
void main()  
{  
    int num = 1;  
    for(num; num<=5; num++)           //for loop to print 1-10 numbers  
    {  
        print(num);     //to print the number  
    }  
} 
// The code prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop in Dart.
